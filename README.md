# WP Prevent User Enumeration
A little plugin based on our tutorial on [How to Prevent User Enumeration in WordPress](https://www.wpexplorer.com/prevent-user-enumeration-wordpress/)

## How to Install the Plugin?
Head over to [releases](https://github.com/wpexplorer/wp-prevent-user-enumeration/releases) download the latest version. Once the zip has downloaded it will have the format wp-prevent-user-enumeration-{version}. You can upload this zip file, but we recommend you instead unzip the folder, rename it to just "wp-prevent-user-enumeration", re-zip then upload it to your site.

Feel free to rename the plugin anything you want and make any modifications needed before uploading it to your site!
